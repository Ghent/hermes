### Inspirations and thanks
I'd like to thank [@gazpachoking](https://github.com/gazpachoking) and the other fine folks at [FlexGet](https://github.com/Flexget) for the inspiration on using YAML and structuring the input and output of the bot.  I plan to emulate this behavior, poorly at best.

I am new to writing my own Python from scratch, so please bear with me while I use this project to learn.
